              <p class="hero_desc"> The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion in control systems is a mathematical method which is reasonable and essential to ensure the stability of an LTI system. The stability criterion of Routh-Hurwitz is a requirement and an effective stability condition. If any control system does not fulfill the requirements, we may conclude that it is dysfunctional. Nonetheless, the control system may or may not be stable if it meets the appropriate criteria. In this paper, the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion is first discussed in brief and also the implementation of the stability criterion using characteristic equation vectors using the MATLAB software. </p>
