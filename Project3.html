              <p class="hero_desc"> An offline alphanumeric character recognition system using natural language processing and the Vanilla Beam Search Algorithm is described in the paper. A new method, called, heuristic search algorithm, usually used in database management applications and natural language preprocessing is introduced for extracting the features of the alphanumeric text imprinted on a rough and noisy surface. Fifty epochs, each containing 115 batches written by various people, are used for training the neural network and 650 different handwritten alphabetical and numeric characters are used for testing. The proposed recognition system performs quite well yielding higher levels of recognition accuracy compared to the systems employing the conventional horizontal and vertical methods of feature extraction. This system will be suitable for scanning alphanumeric characters into structural text for various deep learning based applications and recognizing handwritten or printed alphanumeric text using the vanilla beam search algorithm that has been proposed in this research paper. </p>
