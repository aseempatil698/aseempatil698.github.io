              <p class="hero_desc"> The capital investment for automated analysis of electronic documents has enhanced rapidly since the growth of text categorization and classification. In recent times, various works have been done in the context of text mining and information retrieval. This paper proposes a new method for information retrieval using latent semantic analysis (LSA) and tf-idf also known as term frequencyâ€”inverse document frequency. The proposed method helps to identify the most and least significant words from sentences of the paragraph obtained from a document by splitting the sentences to make the most significant words a query of each sentence. If the word is of the highest priority, then the document will be saved in the drive as a star file. The star file consists of the highlighted less significant words in that document and an array of higher probability words for the respective word at the top of its sentence. The proposed system has been implemented by using a machine learning pipeline, Kubeflow. Based on the analysis of the estimated parameters and calculations of the output graph slope in the system, the model gave a hearty probability of 0.9427 that refers to the accuracy of the system. </p>
