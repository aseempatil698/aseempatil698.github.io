              <p class="hero_desc"> Well I consider myself to be an enthusiast! <br><br>I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. I am majoring in Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My enthusiasm in research for computer vision, ML/DL and artificial intelligence has earned me both technical knowledge and hands-on experience. I have published 13 research papers and have presented my research findings in various international conferences. I have a strong background in theoretical modelling, detection based algorithms and analysis of real world problems. Please feel free to contact me if you need more information or if you want to talk about it. </p>
